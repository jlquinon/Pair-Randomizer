# Pair-Randomizer
Project randomizes pairs of people from a text file. As a coach for my university's dragon boat team, this script automates choosing pairs of people to occasionally lead a land practice from a text file.

## Usage
This python script uses two libraries, sys and random. The sys library is used to accept a text file as a parameter via the interpreter, and the latter is used to randomize the selection and order of pairs.

For the arguments, the project accepts a text file with a list of people you want to pair. The format used is
```
Person 1
Person 2
Person 3
...
```
